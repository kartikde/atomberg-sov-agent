usha,Comment,Why now an average fan makes more noise that you can&#39;t hear sound from watching something on youtube of insta... I have to use headphone mostly or a Bluetooth speaker... 3000-4000 ka fan bhi itna sound krta hai jaise pehle k USha k panther nhi krte th or aaj bhi mast chal rhe hai Gaon me,Negative,1,-2
atomberg,Comment,Please please do not buy bldc fan.<br>Me double pese dekar atomberg bldc fan le aaya tha.. electricity bill me ghanta kuchh farq nahi bada. 2.5  sal bad fan kharab ho gaya..ab repairing ka kharcha alag. Fan chalta bhi kachhua ke jese tha.. rpm very slow.  Aaj kal ke induction fan bhi to 50-60watt ke aate hai.. jo company ka bhi under 2k aa jata hai. Jo 20 sal tak bhi chal jata hai..  phir bldc jhatu lene ka kya fayda..???,Negative,0,-1

atomberg,Comment,"I bought Renesa+ 1400 mm for 194sq.ft. living room. The airflow is felt only below the fan. If you step one feet away from the fan, there is no airflow. Atomberg technician says that Renesa, plus and smart series get a lot of customer complaints but Efficio has no complaints so far. Overall, BLDC 1400 mm fan for a bigger size living room, is not a good choice. I used Orient 52W 1400mm fan earlier and it delivered good airflow. Its heavy duty fan and would last long. Regular 1400 mm fans from Crompton, Havells, Orient, Bajaj are best choices. I have Renesa 1200 mm fans in two bedrooms and its good as the fan is directly above the cot. Noise is a bit more than normal fans.",Negative,156,-157
